          Employee Retention Tax Credit (ERC) Was Put Into Place with CARES
          Act, But PPP Got All the Attention
        </h4>
        <p class="section3__grid-text">
          The pandemic and related shutdown wreaked havoc on businesses, so
          Congress passed multiple stimulus acts to distribute relief quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="section3__grid-text">
          The two programs that got all the media attention were the PPP and
          EIDL programs. Most didn’t even know about the ERC Program, and even
          if so, didn’t think they qualified for it (even though it was as
          good or better than PPP).

          Program Was Poorly Utilized and Understood (even by CPAs), so
          Government Doubled-Down
        </h4>
        <p class="section3__grid-text">
          When few businesses took advantage of the program, the government
          noticed and loosened the qualification rules substantially

          businesses to qualify and get paid. Unlike PPP, there are no limits
          on how much you can receive.

          Many Businesses Don’t Realize They Can Qualify (for $200k on
          average), but the Window is Closing
        </h4>
        <p class="section3__grid-text">
          Most businesses don’t realize they actually can qualify, or were
          told incorrectly by their CPAs that they wouldn’t.
        </p>
        <p class="section3__grid-text">
          It’s not really the CPA’s fault, as the rules were confusing (and
          changed multiple times), and this is a very specialized one-time
          program.
